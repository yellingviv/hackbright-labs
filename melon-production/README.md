Ubermelon got some robots to pick and pack orders!

The conundrum is that squash don't pass inspection because they're the wrong color. So we need to add a method to the Melon-inheriting subclass Squash to paint the squash green.

This was, overall, a very simple exercise with only a tiny amount of code to actually be written. However, it took me quite a while to get it right. My Achilles heel with classes is definitely remembering when the aspect of it I'm calling is an attribute or a method, so I often mess up my deployment of parentheses--I try to turn an attribute into a method, or don't provide a method with the parentheses to pass `self` through.

I need to continue to practice with inheritance, because this is definitely a valuable and powerful part of Python and I see so much potential, but I'm also definitely not yet as fluent or comfortable as I would like to be.
