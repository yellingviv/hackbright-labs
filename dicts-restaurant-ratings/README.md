This was both a very fun and a very challenging lab that spread across multiple days! We were given a text file of restaurant ratings, and then given several different activities to do with it.

First, we created a usable dictionary of restaurants and their rating, ordered alphabetically. Then we added the ability for a user to add a new restaurant and rate it. We then got more fun, adding options such as a command line choice, and letting users update random restaurant scores.

There were a few additional prompts in the `further-further-study` option of the lab, but we didn't get to those. I would like to revisit this lab to work on error handling and input verification, as well as get to the more advanced section in which users are able to call for their own files to open and manipulate from their operating systems.
