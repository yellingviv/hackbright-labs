This is another Ubermelon-focused assignment.

We were provided with two files about the sales that Ubermelon has received--the quantity of melons, types of melons, and income from the melons, and the orders by type, meaning online orders and salesperson-driven orders.

We were also provided with a script that calculates total melons sold by type and income by melon type, as well as compares whether online sales or salespeople-driven orders are more lucrative. However, it was poorly written code.

Our task was to refactor the code to be cleaner and more user friendly. I focused on using as many functions as possible, so that the actual script to generate the output for the report is very short. The functions can be reviewed individually and changed as needed. However, I am very tired of the word "melon." I also focused on using dictionaries as much as possible in order to promote more readable code, unlike the original, which relied heavily on single letter variables and meaningless naming conventions.

Finally, because I like attractive console output, I cleaned up the display to have line breaks, cleaner dividers, and clearer clustering of similar information.
