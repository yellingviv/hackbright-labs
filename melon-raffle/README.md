This is a melon raffle for Ubermelon, because we're wildly successful and now we're keeping our customers loyal with a fun and random RAFFLE!

The original challenge is that there were errors with the random choice module, so we had to fix that. Then we added functionality so that our boss could simply type `python3 raffle.py` and get the raffle winner, instead of having to enter a Python interpreter and call functions and so on.

However, we then get into the `version2` folder, because honestly it's a terrible idea to have all this customer data inside our raffle file. So we refactored and moved things around. It's better, it's smarter, it's prettier. Check it out, because it works beautifully!
