Our first Markov Chain lab!!!

I'm very excited about Markov Chains.

For this lab, we started with a simple text file of a fragment of Green Eggs and Ham as our seed text. We created bigrams from the text, and then chained through to create a new version of Green Eggs and Ham, which would end with `Sam I am`.

Once we got that right, we added the ability to call a text file of the user's choosing, using the command line `sys.argv` input mechanism. We are now working on modifying our chaining mechanism so that the user can input how long they would like the ngram to me.
