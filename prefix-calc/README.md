This is a prefix calculator project for Hackbright Part Time Week 1.

Write a calculator in Python that takes user input for a mathematical operation and the integers upon which to perform the operation.

This is a prefix calculator, rather than an infix calculator. This version is restricted to only two integers currently.

Use the arithmetic module to perform the calculations, then print the answers to the terminal.
