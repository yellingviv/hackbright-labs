I am a student in the Hackbright Academy part time software engineering bootcamp, from October 2019 through April 2020.

These are my lab and homework exercises that I complete over the course of the program as I develop my skills.

In each exercise folder, the `README` file will describe the objective of the exercise and my reflections on it as I work toward improving my skills. Primary reflections are around areas for improvement and struggles I encountered during the exercise.
