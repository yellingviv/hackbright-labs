# SOLUTIONS!

###############################################################################

# PART ONE


# 1. Write a function that does not take any arguments and
#    prints "Hello World".

def hello_world():
    """Prints hello world."""

    print('Hello World')


# 2. Write a function that takes a name as a string and
#    prints "Hi" followed by the name.

def say_hi(name):
    """Greet a user by name."""

    print('Hi ' + name)


# 3. Write a function that takes two integers and multiplies
#    them together. Print the result.

def print_product(a, b):
    """Print product of two integers."""

    print(a * b)


# 4. Write a function that takes a string and an integer and
#    prints the string that many times

def repeat_string(message, times_to_repeat):
    """Print the messages as many times as given."""

    # Neat! Python can multiply a string by an integer!

    print(message * times_to_repeat)


# 5. Write a function that takes an integer and prints "Higher
#    than 0" if higher than zero and "Lower than 0" if lower
#    than zero. If the integer is 0 print "Zero".

def print_sign(num):
    """For num, print if it's higher/lower/equal to zero."""

    if num > 0:
        print('Higher than 0')
    elif num < 0:
        print('Lower than 0')
    else:
        print('Zero')


# 6. Write a function that takes an integer and returns a
#    boolean (True or False), depending on whether the number
#    is evenly divisible by 3.

def is_divisible_by_three(num):
    """Is this number divisible by 3?"""

    # We'll use the "modulus operator", which returns the
    # remainder of division.

    if num % 3 == 0:
        return True

    else:
        return False

    # Or, a shorter and more "Pythonic" solution: since the
    # expression "num % 3" itself evaluates to True or False,
    # we can just return that:
    #
    #   return num % 3 == 0


# 7. Write a function that takes a sentence as one string and
#    returns the number of spaces.

def num_spaces(sentence):
    """Return the number of spaces in the sentence."""

    spaces = 0

    for char in sentence:
        if char == " ":
            spaces = spaces + 1

    return spaces


# 8. Write a function that can be passed a meal price and a
#    tip percentage. It should return the total amount paid
#    (price + price * tip). **However:** passing in the tip
#    percentage should be optional; if not given, it should
#    default to 15%.

def total_meal_price(meal_price, tip=0.15):
    """Find the total price of a meal.

    The total price is the meal price plus the tip.
    """

    return meal_price + (meal_price * tip)


# 9. Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and
#    returns two pieces of information as strings ---
#    "Positive" or "Negative" and "Even" or "Odd". The two
#    strings should be returned in a list.

def sign_and_parity(num):
    """Return a list of [sign, parity]"""

    if num >= 0:
        sign = "Positive"
    else:
        sign = "Negative"

    if num % 2 == 0:
        parity = "Even"
    else:
        parity = "Odd"

    return [sign, parity]


# Then, write code that shows the calling of this function
# on a number and unpack what is returned into two
# variables --- sign and parity (whether it's even or odd).
# Print sign and parity.

my_sign, my_parity = sign_and_parity(7)

print(my_sign)
print(my_parity)


###############################################################################

# PART TWO

# 1. Turn the block of code from the directions into a function.
#    Take a name and a job title as parameters, making it so the
#    job title defaults to "Engineer" if a job title is not passed in.
#    Return the person's title and name.

def full_title(name, title="Engineer"):
    """Return the full  for a person."""

    return title + " " + name


# 2. Given a recipient name & job title and a sender name,
#    print the following letter:
#
#       Dear JOB_TITLE RECIPIENT_NAME, I think you are amazing!
#       Sincerely, SENDER_NAME.

def write_letter(name, title, sender):
    """Print filled in form letter"""

    receiver = full_title(name, title)

    print("Dear {receiver}, I think you are amazing! Sincerely, {sender}".format(
        receiver=receiver, sender=sender))
