This exercise is for automating the Ubermelon order review process.

Instead of manually reviewing orders to see if purchasers have paid the correct amount, this Python script will iterate through the customer-orders file to review the quantity of melons ordered and the price paid to check for over or under payment. It identifies where the payment is off and flags the amount of difference and whether a reimbursement or further payment is required.

It also prints a summary report at the end of the script with the daily total of orders and how many were underpaid and how many were overpaid.
